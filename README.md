# TyTest
A simple typing test in the terminal. Written in C using ncurses.

## Installation
The only requirement is ncurses library (comes preinstalled in macOS and many Linux distros).
Note: if the system ncurses install in macOS runs into problems, you can install homebrew versions of the same.

I am currently working on a makefile, when it is ready you will be able to run the makefile in the terminal to compile and generate an executable.

```shell
cd <directory of download>
make
```
